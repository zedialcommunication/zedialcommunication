        <h1>Refund Policy</h1>
        <h2>General Refund Policy</h2>
        <p>Zedial strives to ensure the satisfaction of our customers. However, as a distributor of third-party services, our refund policies are aligned with the policies of the service providers we represent. Refunds may be issued under the following circumstances:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Cancellation Before Installation:</strong> If you cancel your service request before the service installation, you may be eligible for a full refund of any upfront payments made to Zedial.</li>
            <li><strong>Service Issues:</strong> If there is a verifiable issue with the service installation or activation that is directly attributable to Zedial, we will work to rectify the issue or, in rare cases, process a refund.</li>
            <li><strong>Non-Refundable Items:</strong> Fees associated with the processing of services, including installation charges, activation fees, and administrative costs, are non-refundable.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Refund Request Process</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Submit a Request:</strong> Contact our customer service team within 14 days of the service issue to initiate a refund request.</li>
            <li><strong>Provide Documentation:</strong> You may be required to provide documentation or information regarding the service issue.</li>
            <li><strong>Refund Timelines:</strong> Approved refunds will be processed within 7-14 business days, depending on your payment method and financial institution.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you have any questions about this policy, please contact Zedial customer support.</p>
